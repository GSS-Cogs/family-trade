HMRC OTS data spec for initial conversion 

following the process of the RTS data flow i believe everything can be dropped bar the following:

FLowType differantes between EU and Non EU imports/Exports
OTS is the statistical list of all oversees trade
OTS Commodity - is a more indepth breakdown of commodities afor oversees trade compared with the SITC used for RTS.
Port - would need to be included idenitfy OTS countries point of origin 
Country - required to indentify OTS countries
SITC - required to idenitfy OTS and provide a more broader commodity code to aggregrate up to.
Creation of unit field to denote the numeric column alinged to 

statistical value is gbp thousands 
if the DE could return a list of the OTS commodity list as this would be handy to create a codelist for future use

create OTS codelist is more detailed that the SITC codelist used for RTS and is slightly different to the commodoity codelist used by ONS datasets
