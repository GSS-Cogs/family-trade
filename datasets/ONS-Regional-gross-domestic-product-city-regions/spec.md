### Stage 1. Transform

#### Sheet: Table 1 to Table 13 
    Period : cell D2 across
    Area Type : Cell A3 Down 
    Geo Code : Cell B3 Down
    Area Name : Cell C3 Down
    
    Dimension name unsure? : cell A1 (removing Table ??: City Regions: from string) 
    Marker '-' = ? assuming it means not-applicable as it is only in Table 13 for year 1999. 
   

#### Table Structure

		Period, Area Type, Area Name, Geo Code,  Value, Marker

#### DE Stage one notes 
    'Dimension name unsure' - Not sure what to call this dimension, it relates to the information on each sheet and needed to differentiate the data.

    There are 5 diffferent unit values:
    'Â£ million', 'persons', 'pounds', '2016=100', '%'
    
    Therefore will have to split datasets out into 5 seperate ones unless multiple Measure type issue has changed.
