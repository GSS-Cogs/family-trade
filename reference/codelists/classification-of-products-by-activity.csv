Units receive from the principal on a subcontracting basis textile fabrics fur cutting up, by using automats, such as laser equipment. The aim is to optimise the various parts to be cut and to minimise the scraps. All they do is to cut up the fabrics supplied by the principal and to return the cut up parts to the principal.   Historically this activity is carried out by the manufacturer of the apparel and this outsourced part of the manufacturing process is a part of the manufacture of wearing apparel in division 14. Within division 14 and group 14.1 it could be any of the classes 14.12 to 14.19, depending on the type of wearing apparel ultimately to be produced from those cut up fabrics, but the subcontractor normally does not have information on the final use of the textile parts.  Solution: As the majority of the clothing covered in classes 14.12 to 14.19 would be in class 14.13 (manufacture of other outerwear) the outsourced cutting up of textile fabrics should subsequently also be classified to class 14.13 and in terms of manufacturing services subcategory 14.13.99.

In CPA 2002 there are sub-categories 74.20.40 (""integrated engineering services for turnkey projects"") and 74.20.60 (""project management services related to construction and civil engineering works"").  Solution: Conclusion of the NACE/CPA Task Force 13-15 November 2006. The activity is in NACE Rev. 2 class 71.12. For terminology, see CPA 2002.  Decision date: 15.11.2006  Project management  Problem statement: [From US] (39/40) The definitions exclude project management. What is the definition of project management? If a general contractor subcontracts out each of the steps in the project to different subs - their role, beyond oversight and responsibility for the entire project, is essentially project management. Can a better term be found to describe what I think is the intent of this exclusion - to be in the engineering area, it might need to have arrangement of financing, site selection, etc. beyond those things that are just related to the construction.
