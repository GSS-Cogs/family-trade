Change of Ownership (BOP),BOP,,,"The balance of payments statistics of trade in goods that we compile are derived principally from data provided by HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) on the physical goods exported from and imported to the UK. However, such data are on a different basis from that required for balance of payments statistics. To conform to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) definition, we have to make various adjustments to certain transactions which are not reported to HMRC and also, conversely, to exclude certain transactions that, although are reported by HMRC, do not involve a change in ownership. Furthermore, since the value required for balance of payments is the value of goods at the point of export (at the customs border of the exporting country) as opposed to the value as they arrive in the UK (as HMRC measures), estimates of the freight and insurance costs of transporting the goods to the UK are deducted from the values submitted by HMRC."
